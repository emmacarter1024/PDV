        <h1>About Political Donations in Australia</h1>
        <p>Not sure about the rules around political donations in Australia? We've broken down some of the key points to help you understand the core issues.</p>
        <h2 class="expandable"><img src="./images/expand_less-black-18dp.svg" />&nbsp;The Transparency Register</h2>
        <div class="expandable-content">
            <p>Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918, political parties, candidates and associated entities are required to disclose political donations over a certain threshold. Back in 2005, this threshold was set to $10,000, and it has been indexed yearly with CPI since then, bringing the 2020/2021 minimum threshold to $14,300.</p>
            <p>These donation receipts are compiled and submitted to the AEC yearly, where they are published for the public in the transparency register.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="expandable"><img src="./images/expand_less-black-18dp.svg" />&nbsp;What Are the Problems With This Scheme?</h2>
        <div class="expandable-content">
            <p>There are several issues with the current donation system.</p>
            <h3>The Register</h3>
            <p>The AEC register itself is part of the problem. The AEC transparency register, at the time of writing, is difficult for the average user to make sense of. The data is buried in lists, spreadsheets and individual pages - this is not how the human brain processes information.</p>
            <p>The data needs to be presented in a way that users can aggregate, compare and contrast the data in order to make sense of it.</p>
            <h3>The Timeliness of Disclosures</h3>
            <p>At the moment, parties, candidates and associated entities report their donation receipts at the end of each financial year. In an election year, this is particularly problematic, as you might not be able to tell who donated to a political campaign until after the election has happened.</p>
            <h3>The Donation Threshold</h3>
            <p>Arguably the biggest issue with the transparency register is the donation threshold, as it allows a large proportion of political donations to go unreported. The donation only needs to be recorded if an individual donation goes over the threshold. By splitting the donation across party branches or even just different days, it is possible to donate very large sums of money without any recorded disclosure.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="expandable"><img src="./images/expand_less-black-18dp.svg" />&nbsp;What Can Be Done to Fix the Disclosure System?</h2>
        <div class="expandable-content">
            <p>There are a few things that can be done to fix political donation disclosure system. However, all of them require the political will to do so - both to change legislation and invest in the technology needed to make this accessible.</p>
            <h3>Improve the Usability of the Register</h3>
            <p>Investing in redesigning the usability of the register would go a long way to helping people understand political donations. Rather than building a site which just meets the requirements under the legislation, build a site which helps voters understand the data. This site was built as a 3 week solo project by a part time UX/UI student. Imagine what would be possible if the AEC engaged an experienced UX, UI and development agency?</p>
            <h3>Make Donation Reporting Realtime</h3>
            <p>With the current advances in technology and automation, the 'administrative overhead' argument against recording political donations in real time no longer makes sense. Almost all political parties will already be recording this information electronically as it happens - building APIs to automate getting this data to the AEC should add little to no administrative overhead.</p>
            <h3>Lower or Eliminate the Donation Reporting Threshold</h3>
            <p>The reporting threshold for political donations in Australia is quite high - and it doesn't need to be. The 'administrative overhead' argument - that lowering the donation threshold would increase the administrative overhead falls short in the modern age. Like with real time disclosure, we have the technology to make this happen, we just need the political will.</p>
